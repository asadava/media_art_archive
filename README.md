# the media art archive
my personal, public archive of all of the media cover art i have, scanned in semi-high quality .jpg (and sometimes .png) files. how fun!!!

# legal junk:
none of these images are mine. my ass is covered due to fair use laws, which permit this. also, don't use these for commercial purposes, or i will get nailed to the cross and shot by the feds ok thx bye xx
